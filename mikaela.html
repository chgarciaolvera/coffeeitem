	<p>3/16/17: Hi there! Happy Birthday! I love you my darling!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>4/23/17:</p>
	<p>I know you aren't feeling very well right now. Earlier you asked for a story and I was happy to share one with you. Here's another one in case you ever need my words and I'm not around.</p>
	<p> ~ </p>
	<p>        She danced like the universe was all hers. And you would believe it too; the way her eyes lit up in the night, reflecting all the little stars, making it look like tiny worlds existed in her soul. And her long flowing red silk dress looked magnificent as she twirled and spun around on the dance floor, as she tapped her heels to the beat. Maybe I've had a little too much champagne tonight but, I promise you, you would say the same about her, sober or otherwise. </p>
