	<p>HIIIII MIKAELA ILYSM</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>3/16/17: Hi there! Happy Birthday! I love you my darling!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>4/23/17:</p>
	<p>I know you aren't feeling very well right now. Earlier you asked for a story and I was happy to share one with you. Here's another one in case you ever need my words and I'm not around.</p>
	<p> ~ </p>
	<p>        She danced like the universe was all hers. And you would believe it too; the way her eyes lit up in the night, reflecting all the little stars, making it look like tiny worlds existed in her soul. And her long flowing red silk dress looked magnificent as she twirled and spun around on the dance floor, as she tapped her heels to the beat. Maybe I've had a little too much champagne tonight but, I promise you, you would say the same about her, sober or otherwise. </p>
	<p>        Now I can't say that that night is the clearest in my head, but it is unmistakable in my mind, the moment when she beckoned me over with her glare. She didn't actually say anything; no, her eyes drew me in entirely, without the need for words. I don't know why she would single me out: I'm dressed in a regular semi-casual brown coat and from my facial expression I don't think one would find me the most level-headed in the moment.</p>
	<p>        But then again, she is my girl, still unbelievable to me after all these years.</p>
	<p>        You should've seen the gazes from all the guys on her. I smile, because I know that their attempts are futile. She's been asked to dance from many of them, only to be drawn away after I arrive, as they realize that she is taken. Oh- she is still waiting. I pick up two glasses from the bar, and make my way towards her on the dance floor. She smiles as she sees me come closer. </p>
	<p>        She knows how I love to watch her dance. So she dances for me. Spinning on her heels. Graceful gestures with her arms as her hips swing in her loving acts. She makes her way over, tapping to the beat.</p>
	<p>        If you would ask me, I would say she is magic. The way she approaches me, takes a glass of champagne from my hand and then falls into my embrace, true elegance. We are the stars of the show now. I dip my face onto hers and kiss her with deep passion, and she reciprocates. All the guests applaud- the jealous ones head for the door.</p>
	<p>        "Mikaela, m'lady," I say as I hold my loving girlfriend in my arms.</p>
	<p>        "Why, how goes it, Christopher," she responds.</p>
