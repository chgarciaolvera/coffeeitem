 		<h1>About Me</h1>
 		<p>Hi! My name is Christopher. I'm a 15 year old sophomore in high school who likes to work on projects. In my spare time I like to write code and create virtual art and animations. "CoffeeItem" is the collective title/brand of all my work. While there may not be much to be shown here quite yet, there are many more features that will soon be implemented as I create more and more. Please check in again soon!</p>
